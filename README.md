# üß™ Automation Showcase

This project demonstrates test automation skills using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and TypeScript.

It includes both functional (UI) and non-functional tests against the sample website: [https://automationintesting.online](https://automationintesting.online)

## üß† Design Approach

- **Framework:** Playwright with TypeScript for fast, modern browser automation.
- **Modular Structure:** Tests are grouped and named clearly by feature.
- **Non-Functional Focus:** Includes a lightweight performance test (page load time).
- **Time Efficiency:** Framework and tests created in approx. 2 hours to simulate real-world assessment constraints.
